# nixos-config
My personal NixOS Config

I aliased yolo to `sudo nixos-rebuild boot --flake .#kurohitsugi`

change the hostname to your preference and update alias within user config.


## Some Notes:

Spotify:

Pywal:

>Enabling pywal will add a little activation script for making terminal themes persist between boots. Remove .cache/wal/sequences file after you run wal if you don't want that.
